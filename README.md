Welcome to the **Analog-and-Digital-Clock** repository! This project features a clock that displays both analog and digital time, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the clock interface.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling and layout of the clock, including the analog clock hands and digital time display.
- **JavaScript**: Adds the functionality to update the time dynamically.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The clock will display the current time in both analog and digital formats.
3. The time updates automatically every second.

## Key Concepts

- **Event Handling**: Uses JavaScript to update the time dynamically.
- **CSS Variables**: Utilizes CSS variables for styling the clock hands.
