## üìö How It Works ‚Äî Educational Breakdown
This project is a great example of how front-end technologies can work together to create interactive, responsive interfaces:
- Analog Mechanics: The clock hands are animated using JavaScript and CSS transform properties, simulating real-time rotation.
- Digital Precision: The digital time display updates dynamically using setInterval, ensuring accurate seconds, minutes, and hours.
- Custom Styling: CSS variables (--clr, etc.) allow easy adjustments to colors, sizes, and themes ‚Äî ideal for learning modular design.
- Responsive Layout: The interface adapts to any screen size using vw, vh, and media queries, making it a perfect study case for mobile-first design
